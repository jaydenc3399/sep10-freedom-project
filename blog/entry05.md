#### From the last blog entry I just finished choosing my freedom project tool which was animation. Now with my chosen tool I have been tinkering on many different websites and also watching various videos that will help me with my tool animation. Creating a sort of day by day plan so that I know what to do everyday in class and also outside of class. Some websites that I used to help aid me was [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/applied-visual-design/use-the-css-transform-property-skewx-to-skew-an-element-along-the-x-axis) and [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) also going on youtube for videos. I took some notes and processed things that I learned into my ide, in the learning log and also in my notes. I used various websites to tinker with the new code and information that I got. Using pick code, this is what I tinkered with in [Pickcode](https://app.pickcode.io/project/cm8rnww353pjx13zd9bvggzu7) and also jsbin. These were just some of the ways that I tinkered with my tool to get a better understanding of animation so that I can use it in the freedom project later on.

Some examples of tinkering that I did on pickcode for tinkering looked like this. 

```CSS
@keyframes bounce {
    0% {
      top: 0px;
    }
    25% {
        width: 10px;
        background: red;
    }
    50% {
        height: 50px;
        background: yellow
    }
    100% {
      top: 249px;
      background: green;
    }
  }

@keyframes fly {
    0% {
        transform: translateX(0px);
        background-color: black;
    }

    100% {
        transform: translateX(300px);
        background: lightskyblue;
        width: 20px;
        height: 20px;
    }
}
```
I combined my understanding of keyframes and other things that I learned here like the trasnform property and translate. These keyframes created a change in the animation at different points into the animation as seen in the percentage tiles at 100% it turns blue and the width and height changes
