#### From the last blog entry I just finished choosing my freedom project tool which was animation. Now with my chosen tool I have been tinkering on many different websites and also watching various videos that will help me with my tool animation. Creating a sort of day by day plan so that I know what to do everyday in class and also outside of class. Some websites that I used to help aid me was [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/applied-visual-design/use-the-css-transform-property-skewx-to-skew-an-element-along-the-x-axis) and [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) also going on youtube for videos. I took some notes and processed things that I learned into my ide, in the learning log and also in my notes. I used various websites to tinker with the new code and information that I got. Using pick code, this is what I tinkered with in [Pickcode](https://app.pickcode.io/project/cm8rnww353pjx13zd9bvggzu7) and also jsbin. These were just some of the ways that I tinkered with my tool to get a better understanding of animation so that I can use it in the freedom project later on.
