Devices like apple watches are able to monitor your health and keep track of the progress that you have made while excersizing.[Wearable technology](https://www.catapult.com/blog/wearable-technology-in-sports). Many new devices were now made in the world to help your overal body while doing things like sports. Hydration bottles that remind you when to drink water and checks your hydration levels making sure you dont dehydrate. This is an example of health monitoring technology. Technology has been incooperated into sports, helping boost and keep atheltes safe. Things like mouthguards, diagnostic programs, helmets, etc have all been made to keep people safe. 
* Mouthguards-can monitor the impacts you take and minimize it
* Diagnostic programs, tracking players conditions and checking which is at a higher risk of injury.
* Helmets- Helmets prevent serious head injuries and save you from things like concussions.  


## Engineering Design Process 
I would say right now in the engineering design process im in between the third and fouth stage. I so far have brainstormed some possible solutions and I am still in the process of thinking of the most and best possible solutions, I am creating possible solutions to help people in sports, trying to improve there game and add new inventions that could help revolutionize the sports world and make impacts in the world. Taking technology and sports to the next level.  

## Skills
### Time management
Right now I am doing a few extra activities and sports after school and I get back around 6. After that I have enrolled in some classes outside after I come back home also. But I am able to manage my time and I have a sort of schedule that keeps track of what im supposed to do at a certain time period so that I dont forget to do something later on. Also, so that later on I have some free time to do other things that I want and work on things like my blog and the freedom project. 

### Hard Working/Perserverance
I put my effort into everything and I put 100% effort each time and go over also. When im commited to my work I have full concentration to it without stopping and no distractions. This applys to my work in SEP, if I come to a challenge I just keep going, even if the challenge is hard I will still give 100% effort no matter what because in the end its better to try and get something wrong then to wonder why and accomplsih nothing at the end and be left with regrets. 

### Profesonalism
