#### After creating my MVP for my freedom project we were tasked to create a google slide presentation where we would present to the people in our class and also to show in the expo. The google slides was basically what our project would be about and trying to hook the viewers in on our project. In my [google slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1S8LSHDK6EPt7Vi9eETr8gy11RhT_bVRvWvdfuA54-1A/edit) I layed out the process that I went through to make my website for the freedom project like Part A and Part B, showing the tool I used in my project, the code snippets using animation in my project. I included many other things like my peer feedback and some takeaways that I had while working on my project. After presenting our google slides in class we were going to get ready for. The SEP Expo which is basically where all the SEP students come together and showcase their freedom projects to judges and also other students and the winners get to go to the final showcase and present their project. To practice for this I created a elevator pitch which is basically shortning, presenting my project to just about a minute becasue its just better for jduges to grade and also for other students that were taking notes down to process instead of one long presentation. 

## Takeaways from in class presentation 
### **Staring less at one person and whole class**
While presenting my freedom project some takeaways that I had was to not always stare at the teacher because after I finished my presentation I felt like I looked a little more at the teacher than everyone else. That is one thing that I could work on and looking more at my peers because their isnt a point in the presentation if I am only staring at the teacher the whole time instead of giving my attention to my peers so that they can also feel engaged.

**Be confident and practice before you go up(Be Prepared)** - I found that since i practiced only a little for my presenatiation their were some key factors that I didnt say in my presenattaion that I wanted to like adding onto my hook after I said it, but it was mostly because I was a little nervous and I lost some of the words that I was going to say. But if I practiced before the presenation a little more I could have made sure to say some of the minor parts that I missed. It would also make me more confident in what I say because I found myself saying *um* a lot and I took some time to think after each part. Next time I am going to make sure that I revise my speech a few times and say it to myself so that I dont forget. 


## Takeaways from Expo
## **Always make eye contact no matter how nervous you feel**
During the SEP expo I was presenting to all the freshman perfectly fine but when the judges came I felt a nervous feeling in a way. I made eye contact with the freshman while I was presenting but during the SEP expo when the judges came I found myself making less eye contact than I was with the the freshmans. I turned back not so often to look at the judges but just like in the class presentation I only made eye contact with the boys on my left instead of the girls on my right. This in a way im pretty sure lowered the score for my project down a little bti so for next time I am going to make sure that I look at the entierty of the judges and not just two people, being more calm because when I get nervous I start to not be able to think what im going to say next.
