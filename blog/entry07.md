After creating my MVP for my freedom project we were tasked to create a google slide presentation where we would present to the people in our class and also to show in the expo. The google slides were basically what our project would be about and trying to hook the viewers in on our project. In my [google slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1S8LSHDK6EPt7Vi9eETr8gy11RhT_bVRvWvdfuA54-1A/edit) I layed out the process that I went through to make my website for the freedom project like Part A and Part B, showing the tool I used in my project, the code snippets using animation in my project. I included many other things like my peer feedback and some takeaways that I had while working on my project. After presenting our google slides in class we were going to get ready for. The SEP Expo which is basically where all the SEP students come together and showcase their freedom projects to judges and also other students and the winners get to go to the final showcase and present their project. To practice for this I created a elevator pitch in my [SEP Notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1n9YZLqsv50YrUhVFN-iwL44YH_rncWpJEAocTKbw2i0/edit?tab=t.0) which is basically shortning, presenting my project to just about a minute becasue its just better for jduges to grade and also for other students that were taking notes down to process instead of one long presentation. 

# Takeaways from in class presentation 
### **Staring less at one person and whole class**
While presenting my freedom project some takeaways that I had was to not always stare at the teacher because after I finished my presentation I felt like I looked a little more at the teacher than everyone else. That is one thing that I could work on and look more at my peers because there isn't a point in the presentation if I am only staring at the teacher the whole time instead of giving my attention to my peers so that they can also feel engaged.

**Be confident and practice before you go up(Be Prepared)** - I found that since i practiced only a little for my presenatiation there were some key factors that I didnt say in my presenattaion that I wanted to like adding onto my hook after I said it, but it was mostly because I was a little nervous and I lost some of the words that I was going to say. But if I practiced before the presenation a little more I could have made sure to say some of the minor parts that I missed. It would also make me more confident in what I say because I found myself saying *um* a lot and I took some time to think after each part. Next time I am going to make sure that I revise my speech a few times and say it to myself so that I dont forget. 


# Takeaways from Expo
### **Always make eye contact no matter how nervous you feel**
During the SEP expo I was presenting to all the freshmen perfectly fine but when the judges came I felt a nervous feeling in a way. I made eye contact with the freshman while I was presenting but during the SEP expo when the judges came I found myself making less eye contact than I was with the freshmans. I turned back not so often to look at the judges but just like in the class presentation I only made eye contact with the boys on my left instead of the girls on my right. This in a way i'm pretty sure lowered the score for my project down a little bti so for next time I am going to make sure that I look at the entirety of the judges and not just two people, being more calm because when I get nervous I start to not be able to think what i'm going to say next. 

### **You don't always have to stick to the script that you wrote**
While presenting I found that some of the stuff that I wrote for my elevator pitch was not as eye-catching so I changed it up a little bit. I noticed that my hook that I was going to give was mostly realted to only sports atheltes and not the entirety. I changed the question to a more general question from "Do any of you play for a HSAT sports team?" to "Do you guys play any sports inside or outside of this school?" For my hook, the question I asked was how do ai technology get invovled in sports and to spice this up and make viewers sort of laugh I incldued also a comparison or similairty saying how can ai be incopoerated into the world of sports jsut like chatgpt being incoporated into things like our school, wrting essays and schoolwork. I tried the first hook without saying the part for the chat gpt and man of the viewers were not very amused and not entertained. After changing my script up a little some of the freshmen started laughing at this at my comparison with chat gpt and ai in sports. This shows how you dont always have to stick with the script and its ok to let your mind be free and to thik of other possibilites. A plan is not a set rule on how you should present your project.

# Engineering Design Process
Right now I have reached the end of the enginerring design process which is step 8 where I basiclly communicated my results. I did this by doing the in class presentation amoung with my peers and the teacher where I showed off my wesbite and the future innovations, the tool I used etc. Communicating the ideas I had for sports technology and more. Not only did I communicate my reults with my peers I also communicated my results with the people at the SEP expo which was mainly all freshman and the judges were seniors and I got the chance to share my project and what I made that could be beneficial to sports and how this technolgoy in sports can take your game to the next level, showing off my part b which was the future innovations and what they could do to help take sports to another level.

# Time managment
The end of the school year is coming up and there are a bunch of finals, projects, presentations for each classa. It's become a little hard for me to manage my time including the satruday calsses that I have for SAT. With all this studying and trying to practice for each presentation it has given me less and less time to do other things and less free time. I made a sort of scehdule to help me combat this issue, it includes seperating time each day and prioritizing the ones with closer due dates. Spending mroe time and a little less time on the ones that are due later. This schedule plan has helped me balance both my life making it a little stress free for me so that I can still have time for other things even if that's like thinking about new freedom project ideas that I want to do next year or also having just some free time for me to take a break. 

# Creativity
While working on my freedom project for the expo part I jsut found that my hook was just not intresting enough and that people wouldnt come over to see my project because the hook wasnt good enough. But by thinking outside the box and creating a new hook it started making people laugh and it attracted more people and they ended up liking my project. I also used creativity outside of the freedom project which was for my BHP project which was about electric cars. I thought of different types of ways that could be intresting for the audience. I could use so that they would be entertained and also attract people to our poster board. I bought two electric cars that they could race around which is both fun and also realtes to the topic for our creative and fun part in the BHP fair.
