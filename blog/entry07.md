### After creating my MVP for my freedom project we were tasked to create a google slide presentation where we would present to the people in our class and also to show in the expo. The google slides was basically what our project would be about and trying to hook the viewers in on our project. In my [google slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1S8LSHDK6EPt7Vi9eETr8gy11RhT_bVRvWvdfuA54-1A/edit) I layed out the process that I went through to make my website for the freedom project like Part A and Part B, showing the tool I used in my project, the code snippets using animation in my project. I included many other things like my peer feedback and some takeaways that I had while working on my project.
