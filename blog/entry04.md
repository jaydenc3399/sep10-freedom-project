The tool that I chose to use after tinkering with the different choices of tools was animation. In the beginning I tried to do A-frame and tinkered with it on my ide but I found out that it was challenging and hard to understand. So testing out my other options that I chose out of my three I found one that I was comfortable with and when I tinkered with it. This tool was just perfect for me because it was not too easy and not too hard for me. Webistes that I used [Animate.css](https://animate.style/)
