The tool that I chose to use after tinkering with the different choices of tools was **animation**. In the beginning I tried to do A-frame and tinkered with it on my ide but I found out that it was challenging and hard to understand. So testing out my other options that I chose out of my three I found one that I was comfortable with and when I tinkered with it. This tool was just perfect for me because it was not too easy and not too hard for me. Webistes that I used to learn and tinker with was [Animate.css](https://animate.style/) and also **free code camp** lessons. 

----
I tinkered with animate the css by changing around the numbers for things like the ```animation-iteration-count``` and the ```animation-duration``` by testing and trying out different numbers.
