# Picking a topic
I chose sports because of my passion for sports and the excitement I have when playing. The competitive feeling of going against other people. The sense and determination for winning is what I like about sports. In the beginning I was thinking about doing some other things that involve money like business, or real estate. A websites that was intresting to me on these articles was [The Role of Technology in Buisness](https://www.oksbdc.org/the-role-of-technology-in-business/). But, after thinking for a little bit and doing research and looking at some other topics like sports. A article that caught my mind from [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/neilsahota/2024/03/26/slam-dunk-technology-how-ai-is-revolutionizing-the-game-of-basketball/). It sparked my interest about sports and I had a better knowledge about sports in the beginning from my own life experiecnes. Also, I could find ways to improve the game in ways through my own experiences, putting my own experiences to help solve problems that other people have had and couldnt solve yet. 

# Engineering Design Process 
I'm still currently in the first step of the engineering design process, which is defining the problem. The problem that I am trying to solve is that the world is not accustomed to technology in sports. I am pretty much finishing step one and moving onto the second step which is the research part, I am thinking of using the articles that I see online but seeing that some people like my peers and other people won't always believe in everything online. I would have to try to convince my peers and others to also believe in this issue since it could be revolutionary and help many people like athletes. 

# Skills
Some skills that I picked up from doing the blog are time management, perseverance, and hard working. 

### Time Management
I have several activities everyday after school and balancing it with my personal life and school work is kind of challenging. After school I get out and I go to practice on sports team and sometimes I go out to hang out with friends and play in parks. But, since with the workload and the time I get off practice. I am deciding to cut the time I go out with friends and maybe go out with them on weekends so it doesn't disrupt any of our lives and makes it easier for us to work on the project. 

### Perseverance 
I'm willing to give everything a try no matter how hard the problem is and I battle through pain. Like on the sports team, getting injured was a slight setback but, I still played through the injury to make sure the team did well, I never really thought about my own health. My mind was only thinking about playing but my body was already pushed to the limit. This could help translate to doing the project, not giving up when the challenges are hard and even if I don't understand it, I will be willing to give it a try even if i get it wrong.
