I have been creating and thinking about new ideas and innovations for my freedom project that would be benefical for the future of sports. Innovations and ideas that would help revolutionize the sports world around us and make it better. Including things like the future of Ai and holographic equipment and more that has not been introduced into our world

### Part B Innovation ideas
--- 
 ### I was thinking about creating devices that would be beneficial to athletes. I thought about creating holographic equipment that would help basketball players beform better, like creating holographic defenders. Also incopertaing Ai into the game of basketball. Putting a Ai camera inside a basketball so after a missed shot the retractable camera tracks where you are on the court and locates and rolls back to you. So that you wont have to go and pick it up.
