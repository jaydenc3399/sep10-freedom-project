Including things like the future of Ai and holographic equipment and more that has not been introduced into our world

### Basketball Innovation ideas
 I was thinking about creating devices that would be beneficial to athletes, using my imagination to map out devices and innovations that could help basketball players and atheletes more efficently. I thought about creating holographic equipment that would help basketball players beform better, like creating holographic defenders. Also incopertaing Ai into the game of basketball. Putting a Ai camera inside a basketball so after a missed shot the retractable camera tracks where you are on the court and locates and rolls back to you. So that you wont have to go and pick it up. Self adjusting hoops that can adjust based on the players height, skill and more which can help people train. These are just some of the innovations that I have thought of to improve the game of basketball.

### Volleyball Innovation Ideas
For ideas for volleyball I tried to think about innovations that would help volleyball players play better and also have fun. In this I thought about a robot that helps you as a trainer and helps set and practices it with you. A hand device that attaches onto your hand in order to fix your form and gives you feedback. A volleyball that can turn into any other sport ball like a basketball for example. 


### Finalizing my Content
I reorganized all my points and made them into one so that I could see the informtaion better. We combined the context, Part A and Part B into one so that it wuld be easier to. I also added some pictures and the links to my pctures when I was finalizing it.
