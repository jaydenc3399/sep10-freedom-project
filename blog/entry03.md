##### 12/18/24

### Context 
I have been creating and thinking about new ideas and innovations for my freedom project that would be benefical for the future of sports. Innovations and ideas that would help revolutionize the sports world around us and make it better. Including things like the future of Ai and holographic equipment and more that has not been introduced into our world

### Part B Innovation ideas

### Basketball Innovation ideas
 I was thinking about creating devices that would be beneficial to athletes, using my imagination to map out devices and innovations that could help basketball players and atheletes more efficently. I thought about creating holographic equipment that would help basketball players beform better, like creating holographic defenders. Also incopertaing Ai into the game of basketball. Putting a Ai camera inside a basketball so after a missed shot the retractable camera tracks where you are on the court and locates and rolls back to you. So that you wont have to go and pick it up. Self adjusting hoops that can adjust based on the players height, skill and more which can help people train. These are just some of the innovations that I have thought of to improve the game of basketball.

### Volleyball Innovation Ideas
For ideas for volleyball I tried to think about innovations that would help volleyball players play better and also have fun. In this I thought about a robot that helps you as a trainer and helps set and practices it with you. A hand device that attaches onto your hand in order to fix your form and gives you feedback. A volleyball that can turn into any other sport ball like a basketball for example.

## Engineering Design Process
As of right now I am still in step four planning the most promising solution because I am finalizing all the ideas and trying to find out which innovation from my ideas that I am going to choose. And the idea that would be most beenifcial to teh sports world and help to improve the game of sports. 

## Skills

## Time management 
I was am able to balance my time and do the work that I am assigned with even on a busy schedule. Right now I play for a few teams in our school and sometimes we have games and practices, I dont get home until 7. Which does not leave me much time to do my work. But I make good use of my time and manage it well. I created a schedule and routine to do when I come back home. I put everything that is importnat in the front and put that as a priority to do. With the little free time I have left I usually do other things like working on studing for test or even doing blogs and working more and thinking about the freedom project. 

## Focus/Concentration/Hard Work
When doing work I am fully commited to it and I seldom procrastinate a lot. I stay on the task that im supposed to work on and I don't stop untill the task is done. I dont get distracted easily at all which allows me to be able to concentrate and focus on the work. Applying this into the everyday life and also in our class putting in my hard work and effort because when doing the freedom project it requires people and me to have the dedication and focus to do things and that hard work to get things done. If i fail, in the end its better to try and get something wrong then to wonder why and accomplsih nothing at the end and be left with regrets.
