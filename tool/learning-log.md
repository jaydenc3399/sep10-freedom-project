* I learned about how to hover over objects and once your mouse hovers over the shape the animation plays.</li>
* I also learned about opacity which is basically like turning a shape transparent depending on the number you set it to.
```CSS

  button:hover {
    animation-name: background-color;
    animation-duration: 500ms;
    background-color: yellow;
  }

  ```
I didnt do much to change the code here besides changing the ```background-color: yellow;``` to different colors and I searched some different types of colors I can use on [CSS colors](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_colors.php). I chose to use the color teal ```background-color: #00FFFF;``` using the colors id instead of using the name.

* I learned how you can rotate the shapes to a specific degree.
* Box shadow, adds a shadow effect behind your shape and you can choose the color you want or you can also make it transparent
