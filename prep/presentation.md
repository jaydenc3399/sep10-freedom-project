# Presentation Plan

## Hook
* Just imagine carrying a whole entire basketball field or volleyball field at the palm of your hand and being able to use it anywhere and anytime. I have some possible future innovations like 3-D holographic courts projected by drones and all you need is open space just name when and where.

## Product
* I will first start off with some broad information about sports and how things like devices and hardware and ai apply to the modern generation of sports.
* Small demo clicking around and showing the animations, the tool I used
* Minimize screen to show responsiveness

## Process
* MVP
* Show the Pickcode I used to tinker with like keyframes, translation and more 
* Show my code the parts where I implented and use animamtion to show the use of my tool
* Changes with feedback(Beyond MVP)


## Conclusion
* Takeaways: spending a lot of time choosing the pictures and background code instead of actually doing the project
* Beneifts sports provide
